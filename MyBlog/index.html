	<p>My name is Stephanie Tong. I am tweleve years old and I study Form 1 in Good Hope School. Both my parents are doctors and I have a elder sister and a younger brother. My sister studies in The UK and she is sixteen. On the other hand, my brother is eleven and he is really annoying.I have coding and clarinet lessons each week and I like to read and play the computer in my free time. My favourite authors are Rick Riodan and Kiera Cass, I also enjoy reading on Wattpad and reading comics.</p>
